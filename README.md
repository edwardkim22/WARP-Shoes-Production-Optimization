# WARP-Shoes-Production-Optimization

This project optimizes WARP Shoe Company’s production schedule using mixed integer programming in **AMPL**, solved with **Gurobi**. The objective is to maximize profitability while satisfying constraints on raw material availability, machine capacity, warehouse storage, labor costs and unmet demand penalties. Historical demand data was extracted from a Microsoft Access (.mdb) database using **Java** and **SQL**, with linear regression applied to estimate missing values for February 2006 demand forecasting. The model determines optimal production quantities while enforcing operational limits. Due to computational complexity, the mixed integer program was relaxed into a linear program, with integer rounded solutions analyzed for feasibility.

The primary binding constraint was raw material availability, restricting feasible production levels. Shadow price analysis quantified the marginal benefit of increasing raw material supply, while scenario analysis evaluated the impact of reducing machine hours, expanding warehouse storage and increasing the budget. Results showed that reducing machine hours affected feasibility, additional warehouse space was unnecessary and increasing the budget alone had no impact without greater raw material supply. Key Performance Indicators such as profit margins, machine efficiency and inventory utilization were used to assess different production strategies.

The **AMPL** model consists of `ampl.mod` (model definition), `ampl.dat` (data input), `ampl.run` (execution script) and `ampl.out` (results). Running the project requires **AMPL** and **Gurobi**, Python dependencies (`pyodbc`, `pandas`) for data extraction and Microsoft Access for `.mdb` file access. Completed as part of University of Toronto’s MIE262 Operations Research, this project demonstrates practical applications of optimization techniques in production planning, with future extensions including dynamic pricing strategies and stochastic optimization to handle demand uncertainty.
